# Progressive latent space exploration

Generative Adverisal Net(GAN) has been successful in generating diverse and high-quality samples, which is trained through a adversial training process.
The generation of sample is a transformation from latent vectors folloing gaussian distribution to the sample following the distribution of training dataset. Despite the success of GAN, The process of generation is uncontrolable, since the generation is complex.
